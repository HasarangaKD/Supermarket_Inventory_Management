# Supermarket Inventory Management System 


## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation.
To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. 
First run `npm install` from the root separately. After this you will run `npm run-script install-all` from the root.
From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm run-script client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
